onthebeach programming exercise

Hi, 
Thanks for letting me sit the programming exercise.

My thoughts on the solution are below.
I've kept the library as free as possible of anything that I don't think belongs there, so that's pretty lightweight and stateless.

I started off with the requirements as the first round of tests, but have improved them as I wrote the code, and increased coverage.

Please let me know any feedback
